individual has a justification behind having an unpleasant life. Individuals frequently discuss 
their thoughts via web-based entertainment stages like on Instagram as posts and stories, 
and on Reddit through requesting ideas about their life on subreddits. In the beyond couple 
of years, many substance makers have approached to make content to assist individuals with 
their psychological wellness. Numerous associations can utilize pressure discovery to find 
which virtual entertainment clients are focused on to rapidly help them. 
Stress discovery is a difficult undertaking, as there are so many words that can be utilized by 
individuals on their posts that can show regardless of whether an individual is having mental 
pressure.

on emotional wellness. This dataset contains different emotional well-being issues shared by 
individuals about their life.
